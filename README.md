# HR-ANALYTICS

## MeriSKILL Internship Project

## Overview:

This project represents the culmination of my work as a MeriSKILL intern. The analysis involved the following key tasks:

- Implemented comprehensive data cleaning procedures using SQL and Excel sheets.
- Removed redundant columns and handled duplicates to ensure data integrity.

Utilized Tableau for creating impactful data visualizations, enhancing the interpretability and accessibility of the insights gained.

## Visualization Highlights:

In the visualization, I incorporated three interactive filters to enhance user engagement and exploration of the data. This approach enables users to interact with the visualizations dynamically, gaining deeper insights based on their preferences.
