# HR-ANALYTICS
My last project as a MeriSKILL intern.
In this analysis, I did the following:
Implemented comprehensive data cleaning procedures using SQL and Excel sheets, including the deletion of redundant columns and handling duplicates.
Utilized Tableau for data visualizations.
Understand that in the visualization I used Three filters for more interaction.
Feel free to explore this interactive visualization!
